    <p>Six dice are rolled to begin play. A player must earn 750 points in order to start accumulating points on the scoreboard. Upon rolling the player may hold any scoring dice they choose and then continue rolling the remaining dice. If at any point all
        the dice rolled are scoring points the dice are considered hot. The score is held while the player rolls all of the dice again until they choose to stop or bust. If at any point the the player rolls the dice and there no scoring dice to hold,
        the roll is considered bust and the turn passes to the next player with no score recorded. If the player has already obtained the 750 point necessary to get on the scoreboard they may choose to stop rolling at any point and record the score they
        have rolled.<br> When a player has scored enough points to go out, each remaining player will have one turn to roll and score whatever they can. The player with the highest score will then be the winner.</p>
