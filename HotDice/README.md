Hot Dice

My Grandmother always had dice, cards, board games and puzzles to play when you were at her house. She taught every Aunt, Uncle and Cousin on my Dad's side of the family how to play Hot Dice and Canasta as well as many other games. Hot Dice was easy to play no matter how many people wanted to join in. This was one game that Grandma used to teach us how to be good sports and to have fun with family.


6 Dice are roled
    Single Dice
        1 = 100
        5 = 50
    3 of a Kind
        1 = 1000
        2 = 200
        3 = 300
        4 = 400
        5 = 500
        6 = 600

A player must roll to get a score of at least 750 to get on the scoreboard. 
Upon each roll a player may choose to hold one or more dice and roll the rest until they choose to keep their score and pass, or they bust and do not roll anything they can keep.

Started with getting dice to roll. Started with Intro to Web Development Dice Roller Game. Needed to make 6 dice roll. Found a tutorial using two dice. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53819881/html-form-input-into-javascript-array.

Struggled with creating a table to put the players in. Cody was extremely helpful in getting the array built on the index.html but I got stuck appending it to the table on the play.html page.

Too late I realized I should start with a couple of players preset in the table and could refacter after.
